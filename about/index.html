title: About Eric
---

          <p>I'm Eric! I like music, coding and computer science, and running. This site is a place for me to post my thoughts on the stuff I enjoy.</p>

	  <h2>Music</h2>
          <p>I've been playing guitar for about eleven years; bass on-and-off for about two. I like to think I can sort of sing, and I can find my way around a keyboard with some level of proficiency. 

	  <p>I write and record stuff: sometimes with some of my friends, but usually just on my own. Anything I'm particularly proud of and want to share with the world goes on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/eric-fulmer">my SoundCloud</a>. My Last.fm is <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/probablyeric">here</a>. I like to think everything I listen to influences me in some way.</p>

	  <h2>Coding</h2>
	  <p>I really like computers and learning more about them. I'm interested in functional programming; right now I'm working on learning the Rust programming language. More on that in future posts!</p>

	  <p>I wrote a web app to help organize the musical recommendations I get from my friends. You can find it at <a href="http://erics-music-tracker.herokuapp.com/">http://erics-music-tracker.herokuapp.com/</a>. Let me know what you think of it.</p>
