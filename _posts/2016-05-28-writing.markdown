I've been reading the IntermezzOS book, and a quote from it stood out to me:

Writing is natureâ€™s way of showing us how sloppy our thinking is. -- Leslie Lamport

This line above is a much more concise explanation of why we should write. It honestly makes the rest of this post superfluous.

If you want to be organized and remember things well, you have to write. I'm not referring to keeping a journal, though that's definitely useful and I try to journal as much as I can. 

What I am telling you to write down is *anything you want to remember, or anything you want to understand*. It's perfectly possible to remember and understand things without writing them down, but forming (reasonably) complete sentences and paragraphs on things you're studying, or important take-away ideas from a speaker or a meeting does a lot for your comprehension.

Imagine this situation: You're in an interview, or updating your boss on a project's status, or answering an instructor in class. You've covered the material that you're being asked about. You know the material, but when you need to speak about it, you stumble over your words. Not due to any sort of anxiety or awkwardness, you're struggling with the act of verbalizing your thoughts on the issue. 

You probably didn't need to imagine that situation, because you've probably experienced it before. I've been in it many times. I'll need to answer a question, and while I **know** the answer, I've never actually had to **express** it to another person. The problem originates when you have to go from the "soft" area of the thoughts in your brain describing the thing, to the "hard" verbalization of it, in complete sentences and statements.

The reason for writing, then, in greater depth, is to solidfy your understanding. This includes writing out what you don't understand. 

Maybe that sounds like a waste of time to you. I say it isn't. I say it's vital to your understanding. Repetition is key to being good at something. Think of a bodybuilder who walks into the weight room, does one deadlift at a light weight, then takes the plates off the bar and heads home, thinking "Well, I've proven I can deadlift. That's good enough for me." That guy's not going to get any stronger without changing up his weightlifting program. The detais may change, but it's absolutely certain this guy will be doing more than that one single deadlift. 

Now that we've established what and why you should write, the next question is how*. 

Most of what I write down falls into these categories:

1. Things I understand a little, but not fully. I write them down to gain a better understanding of them.
2. Things I don't understand at all. I write them down to push myself to begin understanding them.
3. Things I need to remember or record. Meeting notes, workout session details, and things like that fall into this category.

Write things out with pen and paper, whenever possible. I use pencil, but that's because I'm weird. And because I have a math degree; erasing things is much cleaner and more pleasant than handing in an assignment with a bunch of crossed out and revised answers on it. Eventually I moved on to LaTeX, but that's because I'm extremely weird. 

I'm deliberately ignoring the "how do you write" question because that's about your own personal style. [Just write.](http://efulmer.github.io/2016/02/28/how-to-learn-to-code/).

There are two reasons I suggest writing on pen and paper rather than digitally. The first is that it's harder to revise something you write out by hand. This forces you to think about the sentence you want to write before you actually put pen to paper. The second is linked to the first: handwriting requires much more focus than typing. It's very easy for me to type something lightning fast, without even looking at the keyboard, with a gramatically correct result. This is much harder to do when writing out things by hand. The goal here is to understand things and increase your knowledge. **Thinking** is vital for this.

I don't like regular old marble or spiral notebooks for this, honestly. They're a little too big to comfortably carry around. Every so often, I head over to the Muji store in Soho and buy a few of the small pocket-sized notebooks they sell. I end up finding subjects to dedicate each to, and at $1.25, I can pick up 4-5 of them every so often and not even notice.

* And for all the smart alecs reading this, the answers to "when should you write" and "where should you write" are "whenever and wherever you think it'd be useful." Sometimes I'll pull out a notebook and pencil, sit down on the nearest bench or whatever and write out whatever interesting thought came into my head. Sometimes I think it looks weird, but it probably makes me look brilliant and arty and interesting.
