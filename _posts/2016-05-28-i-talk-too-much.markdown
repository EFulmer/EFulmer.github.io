title: I Talk Too Much
---

I use too many words.

I consider it a problem. People have limited attention spans. If you take too long to get your point across, you've lost your audience.

I've been aware of this for a while, but its importance only occurred to me a few days ago. I was in a meeting and someone I was talking to said "Eric, get to the point already." 

I wasn't even offended. In fact, the main thought I had was *he's right. I should get good at that.* 

Now that I've identified the problem, I'm working on solving it. I'm trying shorter paragraphs and shorter sentences. And of course, writing everything out. Less qualifying my statements with weak, weaselly phrases like "well, I think" or "usually, it tends to be the case." 

And it could be worse. I have a clear, strong voice that carries, and I've never had confidence issues about speaking in front of other people. I just need to focus.

See you on the other side.
