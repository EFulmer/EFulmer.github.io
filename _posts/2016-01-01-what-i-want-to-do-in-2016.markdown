title:	"What I Want to Do In 2016"
---

2015 just ended, and while I'm not big on resolutions, I think that I could do with some more self-analysis. To that end, I'm going to list out some things I'd like to do in 2016. 

Some of them are discrete events, like reading a book or learning a language well enough to complete X task in it. Others are more general, like biking more and drinking less coffee. As I'm not generally a hyper organized go-getter, I'm not going to set out a day-by-day, or even week-by-week plan of action. Just some general thoughts on habits and accomplishments I'd like to reflect on on January 1st, 2017.

Coding/Professional
===================

Write a compiler or interpreter
-------------------------------

This has been kicking around in the back of my mind for a few years now. As a software engineer, I'm reliant on compilers and interpreters to do my job, and I find it embarrassing that I don't know more about them than I do. If you asked me, I'd be able to tell you that they parse source code into an AST, link different source files/libraries together, and output a runnable binary or bytecode. And at a very high level, that's correct. But I'm not comfortable with that answer. So I'm gonna write my own... with a little help from my friends, of course.

To actually solve this, I'm going to spend a few weekends working through the tutorial [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours). I've attempted it a few times before, and each time it's just sort of fallen off my to-do list. So what's my plan to ensure I finish this time? I'll write accompanying articles on it.

After Write Yourself a Scheme, I'm considering working through the course materials for [Matt Might's compilers course](http://matt.might.net/teaching/compilers/spring-2015/) - maybe in Rust. Rust looks exciting. I have another Rust project in mind, though, so I'm not sure what I'll do.

Get really good at one language
-------------------------------

A few months back, someone I know said they think the path to a successful software engineering career is picking one thing and focusing on it until you become great of it: either very high level functional programming like Haskell, Scala, and Clojure, or low level embedded/systems level development in C or ASM. Since the guy's older than me, and a pretty successful Python expert, I'm going to follow it. 

I think that a great way to get exposure to both high and low level engineering, and to decide which to go for, is through significant projects in both Haskell and Rust. Writing a compiler or interpreter in Haskell is using a high level language to perform a more low-level task. Rust is designed with industry in mind, but incorporates a lot of high level research FP ideas. [interemezzOS](http://intermezzos.github.io/) looks really cool, so after I finish my Haskell interpreter, I'll be looking at it in depth. One thing at a time, though!

Write more
----------

I keep a journal with some regularity - for a few weeks I'll write in it daily, then I'll forget about it for a few weeks. There is something very useful about expressing your thoughts somewhere outside of your head, especially when you write them down on paper. I'm guessing it's because writing and typing are a lot more physical than chemicals and electrical impulses jumping around in your cranium. Either way, I'd like to get on it with more regularity. I'm not aiming for a perfect 366 days this year; it's okay if I don't stay up and write if I get in insanely late and have work the next day Just more often than not.

Blogging, too. I'd like to write a few posts a month. Mostly on technical stuff, but other things that I feel like sharing with the world, rather than a Moleskine I keep lying around in my apartment. Why running is so great, for one. Why Andrew W.K. is one of the smartest people on Earth. Why "Live Forever" might be the most human song ever written. We'll see. I'm starting here by setting an hour long timer and just writing what comes to mind on the general subject of what I'd like to be better at.

Health
======

There's a few changes I'd like to make in my life. I'm 26, and while that's still pretty young, if I screw up somewhere and fall off my bike, I'll be feeling it for a few days. My parents and some of my cousins are getting up there in age, and I've seen a few unfortunate reminders of their mortality. I'm fine with my own days being numbered, but I'd like those days to be wonderful, in terms of both quality and quantity.

Eat better
----------

I'm thinking that this is the big one. While I usually eat healthy meals, I have a very bad habit of eating out of boredom. Avocados and lean ground beef don't mean so much if I chomp down an entire bag of potato chips while I'm bored later. To this end, I'm gonna do two things:

* Try going vegetarian for a while. Having to drop meat will make me be a little more conscious of my food choices in general, and it's just a conscious move to make. I'm completely fine ethically with meat, but it does seem to me that we often treat the animals we raise pretty badly. 
* Make a food log by taking pictures of everything I eat. I've been powering through [Mr. Money Mustache's massive backlog of posts](http://mrmoneymustache.com) lately, and this suggestion from his [How to Be Slim](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/19/how-to-be-slim/) article stuck with me. I've been trying this for the last few weeks, and I've been doing a pretty good job.

In a month or two I'll try and make some general observations of how I feel and how well I've stuck to these things.

Drink less coffee
-----------------

I know that coffee is pretty healthy for you, or at least health-neutral. But more often than not, my daily caffeine intake matches Lemmy's daily Jack Daniels intake (R.I.P. man, you were incredible and you're missed by more people than you'd have guessed). I don't like feeling so dependent on it, so I'm limiting myself to one a day. I already cut out any sort of take out coffee (Dunkin', Starbucks, etc.) from my diet and budget; only exceptions are dates and going out to eat.

Lift weights
------------

I hear it's really good for you. I'm quite happy with my cardiovascular health: I haven't run in a few days, but I've had weeks where I ran 4-6 miles every day without feeling much strain or soreness the next day. But I know that cardio's only part of the issue. Soon I plan on joining the gym one of my best friends goes to and using him as a partner/spotter/mentor. 

Read more books
---------------

This is sort of health related! A big part of it being on is because the internet is my only real vice other than coffee, and all that staring at screens can't be good for my eyes. 

As a kid, I was an *obsessive* reader. I would read anything I could find - kids books, magazines, my mom's nursing school textbooks, the backs of cereal boxes. But I read two books last year: *The Millionaire Next Door*, and *Wherever You Go, There You Are*. I kind of miss going to the library; not as much as I like paychecks, but I can still make time for it. I have a few books I'd like to read, *Walden* and *The Selfish Gene* are pretty high up on the list. I don't expect to fully cut random Reddit stuff and similar white noise out, but I know I'll be re-balancing the random internet stuff:books and useful internet stuff ratio from now on.

Random
======

Learn to sew
------------

I think this'd be a cool skill. I have a shirt where a few stitches have come out of the pocket, and being able to mend something like that on my own would be a really awesome self-reliance type of skill. I was pretty good back in home ec, so I'll be checking up on whether 26 year old Eric is actually better than 13 year old Eric pretty soon.
