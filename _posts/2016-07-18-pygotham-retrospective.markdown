title: PyGotham Retrospective
---

[PyGotham 2016](http://2016.pygotham.org/) was this past weekend. It was the first Python conference I attended, and the second software-related conference I attended. [Compose](http://www.composeconference.org/2016/speakers/) this February was the first conference I ever attended, though I had to miss day 2 for an emergency.

I thought the conference was great. There were a huge variety of talks -- plenty on data science, but there was one on monitoring circulatory function, one given by an English professor, and even a high schooler who came from San Jose to give a talk on Python and chess. There was also no ego; just a lot of people wanting to share and absorb knowledge. People were relaxed and friendly; I saw a lot of people from NYC Python, and a lot of people I didn't know, and they all were great. It was a great weekend.

Some talks I really enjoyed:

* Matt Lavin's talk: Teaching and Doing Digital Humanities with Jupyter Notebooks. I was an English Lit major for a few years in college, so anything related to literature makes my ears perk up. So does Lovecraft -- not huge on him, but I'm into metal, so I care about him by proxy. Matt's talk was pretty intense on both the technology and literature fronts. I loved it.

* Aaron Hall's talk: Best Practices for Writing Reusable Python. There are so many different learning resources for Python, it is easy to consume a lot of information, work your way through multiple books and tutorials, and still miss something. This is a good thing -- the standard library is very comprehensive and powerful. I consider myself past the beginner stage but I learned from this talk. Also Aaron gave me a great explanation of what goes into a good unit test, which I'm very grateful for. Nice guy!

* Marcus Willock's talk on Go: Wrapping Go in Python. Very well prepared, and he just has a great presentation style. Go is cool and with the number of companies I hear about using both, I can see a few people immediately putting the knowledge Marcus imparted upon the audience into effect.

* Katie Cunningham's keynote; Empathy and Teaching. First off, Katie was very amusing, and also informative! I'm lucky if I can manage one of those well. I would go so far to say that if you watch only one talk from this conference, it should be this one (I'm sorry Matt and Aaron). Also shout-out to James for being such a good volunteer.

After this event, I'm definitely going to PyGotham 2017. Hopefully; I was impressed and would like to add to the community by spreading some knowledge myself!
