title: "Getting Back Into Writing"

This blog has been rather quiet lately. A few different things in life have collided, and I haven't had much energy for writing, either posts or code. 

For me, fixing that requires an initial effort. Sometimes that feels overwhelming, but once it's done it's so satisfying. For anyone else out there who's in that rut, try something simple and go from there. Like I am now!

I've got two major projects I want to work on: 

1. Getting more into Linux. I use a Mac (partially for GarageBand, partially because I'm consistently impressed with the support and build quality of Apple products), but my work is mostly in the .NET environment. I'm going full hog into Debian, and I'll post a series of articles on that.
2. Learning [Rust](http://rust-lang.org/). Rust seems pretty interesting to me, as a venue for exploring both functional programming further, and a way to get some experience in systems programming at the same time. As a new language, it's risky, but I think I'm willing to take this risk.

I'm hoping to write weekly blog posts on my efforts. See y'all soon!
