title:	"(Re-)Learning Hskell"
---

I don't actually remember where I first heard of Haskell. It was sometime in the middle of 2012, probably on Reddit, when I was unemployed. I think somebody mentioned it in a thread about resume and career advice. I remembered looking it up, thinking "wow, it looks really hard, so it's definitely worth learning," and ordering *Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!*. 

I read all of *LYAH*, plus some more beginner-level books and tutorials on Haskell, and I started attending the New York Haskell Users Group's monthly meetups. But I never wrote much Haskell code. I solved a few dailyprogrammer and Project Euler problems in the language, and that was about it. I attempted [*Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours*](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours) a few times, but got sidetracked.

And that's a shame, because Haskell is a neat language. I'd like to put all the time I spent dorking out about it to good use. I wouldn't say I really **know** a programming language until I've written a reasonably-sized application or library in it, and I don't think many software engineers would disagree with that sentiment.

So, I've decided to "re-learn" Haskell and write some stuff in it! I'm starting by re-reading *LYAH* -- I finished the first third or so today. I absolutely love the friendl and casual tone. The big problems with it are that it's a little short on strong real-world examples and it doesn't really have any exercises to test your understanding. Even with that, it's a nice and friendly introduction to strongly typed functional programming. A GitHub user named Noel Markham wrote up his own [exercises for *LYAH*](https://github.com/noelmarkham/learn-you-a-haskell-exercises), though, and I'm gonna be working through them.

I'm hoping to finish *LYAH* tomorrow or Sunday, and from there go on to re-doing *Scheme in 48 Hours*. While I've failed to finish it a few times before, it's been due to loss of interest or distraction from Big Life Stuff. This time, I plan on writing my own notes and explanations for each chapter. 

Here goes! I'm excited to blow my mind a few times with fancy computer science nerd stuff.
