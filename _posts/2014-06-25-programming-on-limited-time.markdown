title: "Programming On Limited Time"
---

I've got a pretty long commute to work. I actually don't mind. It's all on NYC's public transit, so very little of it is "dead time". It gets me an hour or two of good reading time a day, and I really appreciate that. 

Juggling programming for my own personal interest with the limited amount of hours I have outside of work and commuting, though, is a challenge. I've only got a couple of hours a day to fit in coding and all the other stuff I like to do; music, working out, all that stuff.

That presents a pretty good problem to solve, though. Figuring how to fit personal-interest programming in with everything else is the type of challenge I like.

I've tried bringing my laptop along on the bus, but even though it's a relatively small 13" MBP, I'm usually a little short on room. When the next seat's far enough away that I can open it, there's someone sitting next to me and my elbows would be crowding them out of their seat. What a difficult life!

So what I've been doing is going to coffee shops, taking advantage of their free wi-fi and paid caffeine. I like it -- not sitting around at home, flipping between tmux tabs in solitude provides a nice ambience. Humans are social animals, after all.
