This post is slightly personal. I don't really talk about anything that's emotionally charged, but it's about something I've spent a lot of time working on.

I've been playing guitar for 10 years. Most of that time's been spent working on technique and theory knowledge. Once in a while, I've tried writing songs, but I've always immediately ditched them because they sound like something else. I'd come up with a riff, play it a few times, then decide it sounded like a ripoff of a song I liked and drop it. 

After spending a long time doing that, I decided that I just wasn't a creative person. My focus was more on having great technical skills to be a great guitarist for someone else. It wasn't until I graduated from college and started working that I changed my mind on that. 

One of my coworkers also plays guitar, and we used to argue about creativity. I insisted I wasn't a creative type, and he said that creativity is something you can practice and get better at. He ended up giving me an old audio interface of his, and I've been playing around with it.

I've also spent some time thinking about what it means to be creative. Noel Gallagher had a good quote on how all art's inspired by something earlier:

> "In the case of Don't Look Back in Anger – I mean, the opening piano riff's Imagine. 50% of it's put in there to wind people up, and the other 50% is saying 'look, this is how songs like Don't Look Back in Anger come about – because they're inspired by songs like Imagine'. And no matter what people might think, there will be some 13 year old kid out there who'll read an interview and think 'Imagine? I've never heard that song' and he might go and buy the album, you know what I mean?"

So lately, I've just been rolling with it. I've been writing and recording. No complete songs yet, but I've got one in progress that I really like. It sounds a hell of a lot like Kevin Shields, but I like Kevin Shields. It's only natural to make music that sounds like your inspirations. Once I've got something more complete, I'll post it up on SoundCloud. I'm trying to do this with other things too; like coding, or this blog. I hope to finish my Scheme interpreter soon, then go back to the Python music app, and maybe write something small in Rust; a helper library for working with the Last.fm API maybe?

If you take one thing away from this post, it should be this: Go for it. Make something, and don't be afraid of copping your influences, or sounding rough around the edges. Just do it and have a blast.
