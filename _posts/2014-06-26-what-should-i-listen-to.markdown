title: "What Should I Listen To?"
---

I have a problem. 

I have more music I want to listen to than I have time to listen to it. My friends recommend me bands all the time, and I never listen to all of them. Adding them to an long-running note on my phone doesn't help anything. Let's say someone tells me I should listen to The Cure. I've never heard anything at all about them. Where do I start?

I'm making a little app to solve this problem. It's called *What Should I Listen To?* and it's on GitHub [here](https://github.com/EFulmer/whatshouldilistento). The main idea behind it is to track the artists you want to check out and get some info on them. For example, their best-reviewed album, when they're going to be on tour, and stuff like that.

Right now I'm developing it in Python using Flask, but I've had an interest in learning Ruby too, which I'll write about later. Maybe if I get bored I'll rewrite it as an exercise in learning Ruby! For now, I'll try to write regular posts on its development.
